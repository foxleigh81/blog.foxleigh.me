[![](http://139.59.160.63/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_15071-300x225.jpg "IMG_1507[1]")](http://foxleigh.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_15071.jpg)This weekend I have decided (against my better judgement) to not sleep for 18 hours and instead to attend Dom Hogeson's (@[thehodge](http://www.twitter.com/thehodge)) excellent #[Leedshack](http://leedshack.com/) event. We have a great team this year with Will Saunders (@[willsbrain](http://www.twitter.com/willsbrain)) on illustration/design duties, myself on UX development and animation and Paul Johnson (@[rusty\_box](http://www.twitter.com/rusty_box)) running the backend.

We are going to try to create an exciting - and temporarily secret (although our team name is Textagotchi so you may be able to guess what we're doing) - application using the [mediaburst](http://www.mediaburst.co.uk/) API, our hope is to either make a million-pound idea and/or win a nexus tablet.

You can follow our progress on our new [twitter account](http://twitter.com/textagotchi). I may even set up a live stream at some point (if the internet ever starts working properly) so you can all look at my beautiful face as I code.

Wish us luck!

As you've probably noticed, if you've been here before. I've updated the theme! I finally got around to making a completely customised one based on the '[sandbox](https://wordpress.org/themes/sandbox/)' template.

It's not 100% perfect yet, the comments still look a bit crap, the images on the home page are square for some reason and there are a few features I've yet to add to it but it's good enough for launch so I figured, [fuck it, ship it](http://lifehacker.com/5934647/fuck-it-ship-it).

Keep an eye out for future updates as they are definitely on the horizon.

If you want to use the theme yourself. Feel free to clone it from [Github](https://github.com/alexward1981/lxword), however I didn't make this for others, I made it for me so you might have to crowbar in any extra features you want to use. Also that repo is for my entire blog (no, I didn't commit the config file before you go looking) so you'll have to dig around for the theme. However I've got quite a nice build too set up there so feel free to use that too!

Update: Everything is looking half decent now. I've replaced the old comment system with Disqus too so apologies if any of your old comments were lost. I know there were not that many anyway.

There are still things I want to do. I think the header should be reduced on article pages and a featured image er... feature added to make landing on articles look a bit more special. Plus I've decided that the 'quirky' way the articles flow on the home page isn't quirky, it's rubbish, so I'll be adding a masonry grid soon too.

It's all in front of you like a wheelbarrow!

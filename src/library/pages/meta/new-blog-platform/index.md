OK it's been a long old while since I've bothered with this blog. Part of it (although this is totally an excuse) is that I've never really been a fan of WordPress. So I've migrated it all to a new platform. Welcome back!

For those who are interested, the blog now runs on a software platform called [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), it's a website building platform which uses flat-files instead of databases which means I no longer have to faff around with a CMS and can just write posts in markdown - which is lovely :)

I've also taken the opportunity to refresh the design a bit. It's far from finalised and I've still got a lot of tweaking to do, for a start off, I haven't made it responsive and I've not really put any thought into the colour scheme, so expect lots of changes over the coming weeks/months/years.

I've also got a new name, my old blog was called 'LXWord' which is how you would pronounce 'Alex Ward' in a Hull accent (my home town) but I'm not Alex Ward anymore, I'm Alex Foxleigh. So I've decided to go boring and just call it 'The Foxleigh Blog'.

## A few things to note

### Legacy tags

EVERY article posted before this one has got a 'legacy' tag attached to it. This means that the article was written for a previous iteration of the site and I can't guarantee that it will look good. I plan to go through articles which still have some merit and update them but I have no idea when I'll find the time to do that so you can expect to see the legacy tag for quite some time.

### Pagination

Not added pagination yet, who knows, maybe by the time you read this post, I will have done but until then, happy scrolling. 

### Search

Same as above, it's pretty near the top of my to-do list but I've not gotten around to it yet.

So that's it. New blog, hope you like it.

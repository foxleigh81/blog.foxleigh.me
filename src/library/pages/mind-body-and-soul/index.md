I've been on the path to become a better person for as long as I can remember, somethings I've been successful at, some things I'm still working towards. Most of these things are related to either improving my mind (education, mental health etc...), My Body (exercise, diet, etc... - I'm not great at this one) or soul (Things which nourish me in a way neither physically nor mentally but nonetheless, some part of my being is improved by them). Consider this category a roadmap on my path to enlightenment.

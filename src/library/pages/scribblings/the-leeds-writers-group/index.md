If you are a regular reader of my blog (do I have any readers yet?) then you will have probably heard me wittering about my beloved writing course which I attend every Wednesday, as much as I value the learning part of the course I quickly discovered that by far the most useful and enjoyable part of the course was reading my work to other writers and in turn hearing the writing of my peers. I found the sharing of ideas and the feedback involved in this process to be invaluable. Aside from this it was also very motivating to have a weekly deadline impressed upon you and forced your laziness to take a back seat (which I imagine it would have enjoyed anyway) to your passions.

Sadly, my course is nearing an end and it seems possible that the final part of the course will not go ahead, I broached the idea of creating this meet-up group to a few of the more gifted members of my class and they thought it was a great idea, so here we are.

If you are a budding writer and would like to meet up once a week to read your work and to hear the work of others then please join. It is a free group and always will be although if it gets too big/inconvenient to host it at members houses (I gladly offer my apartment up as a location for our forum) then we will probably move it to a quiet bar or coffee shop. As my Wednesdays are about to become free, I suggest that day be the day for our meet up.

At the moment the group is invite-only, I will eventually make it public but this is the first time I've ever tried to organise anything like this so I'd rather keep it small for now. However feel free to contact me and I will happily add you to the group if it has not grown too large (which I'm sure it won't do for a while anyway).

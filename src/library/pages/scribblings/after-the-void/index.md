Here is a little snippet for a short story I am writing, as always, your feedback is appreciated :) :

>  
> 
> Somewhere in the distance she heard a gentle drumming sound. It was growing louder, the world flashed red and suddenly glowed a brilliant, blinding white. The Darkness screamed as it was torn away

> ...
> 
> He felt like he’d forgotten something, someone, a woman, she felt to him like a distant dream echoing from the past, he heard a noise. The sun rose in the night sky.
> 
> The Darkness screamed as it was torn away.
> 
> …
> 
> A light shone in the Darkness, the Darkness tried to extinguish it but the light was stronger. He felt the pull of life surge through him, where was he? What was that drumming sound?
> 
> The Darkness screamed as it was torn away.

> Mark watched with amazement as the chemicals began to work their magic, it had taken his team decades to perfect this formula, each one of them knew exactly how it worked and yet, seeing in action felt alien, this was not science. This was the work of God. This was magic.

> Each of the bodies started to twitch, it was both fascinating and grotesque to watch their decomposed remains reconstruct themselves.

> Mark smiled.

title: "What is a Front-end Architect and why do I need one?"

**In the last few years the web development sphere has evolved, with the introduction of Agile project management and the increasing prevalence of automated systems, a need has arisen for someone to provide structure and standards to a website project to ensure that the best can be brought out of any project.**

**This is where a front-end architect comes in.**

## **So what does a front-end architect do exactly?**

When a website is set up, it's often the job of the front-end developer to set everything up, if they are experienced in project architecture then this is often not too much of a problem. However often, a developer will be very eager to just start coding without taking the time to consider the bigger picture and in fact may not have the specialist knowledge required to be able to set a site up in the best possible way.

A front-end architect will be involved in a project from its inception, they will sit in client and production meetings and take the time to work out the needs of the client.

When it is time to build the website, they will use the information they have gleaned from the meetings, combine it with their knowledge and experience of site structure and web standards and derive a system where the website can easily be built upon in the future.

## **This will usually involve the following:**

- **Setting up the site skeleton:** This comprises of determining the folder structure (usually alongside the consultation of the lead backend developer) and creating all the required initial files.
- **Developing a build system:** This will involve using the most appropriate technology to build a tool which will allow your front-end developers to keep the site technologically up-to-date, it will inspect code to ensure that any code added to it adheres to a set standard and it will also greatly increase the productivity of your developers.
- **Setting a standard:** One of the biggest mistakes most web developers make is not setting a standard at the start of a project that all developers must adhere to, these standards often need to be custom-made depending on the requirements of the client so it's not possible to just use an 'off-the-shelf' standard and hope it fits perfectly.
- **Generate a style guide:** Working with the designer (if there is one, a front-end architect is often a designer as well), a style guide will be produced which will provide developers and content editors with instructions on how to maintain the branding throughout the site. This will include things like, colours, fonts, standard sizes, tone of voice for textual content etc...
- **Building the initial templates**: A good front-end architect should deliver a set of components which developers and content editors can re-use to build the site from. This usually involves providing a set of initial templates for the development team to integrate into the main code-base.
- **Overseeing the project:** This one doesn't always need to happen but it can often be beneficial to keep a front-end architect on hand to oversee the development of the project. This doesn't usually require keeping them on-site at all times as a periodical review is usually sufficient.

## **Is a front-end architect just a fancy name for a front-end developer?**

No. A Front end architect will not be involved in the final delivery of the website, nor will they be directly involved with development after the template has been provided. They can be thought of as an initial consultant rather than a core member of the team.

## **A front-end developer can do all this though, right?**

Some will be able to, yes. However the scope of 'front-end developer' has grown a lot over the last few years, the term front-end developer now covers everything from basic HTML coding to really advanced JavaScript development and even occasionally back-end integration.

This put a lot of pressure on front-end developers as it's almost impossible for one person to be able to do all that and still focus on producing quality.

The market is starting to split the role up into it's component parts and Front-end Architect is one of those specialisms, this is a good thing as it means everyone can focus on their specialties and thereby deliver a more robust product.

## **How long will a front-end architect work on the project?**

Obviously that depends on the size of the project. However for a small to medium sized project, I would imagine that their involvement would be limited to the first two or three months, maximum. Larger projects may require more time.

## **If I have a front-end architect do I need to hire a front-end developer as well.**

Yes but not immediately. Traditionally the Front-end developer would start at the same time as there rest of the team, however there is little benefit in hiring someone in this role until the last few weeks of the Front-end Architect's consultation. This overlap will allow time for the new developer to acclimatise themselves to the standards put in place by the Architect.

When you do hire a Front-end developer, you can hire someone who is relatively inexperienced as all they will need to do is follow the instructions laid out to them by the architect. This will mean that they won't cost as much.

## **So what are the benefits to the client/agency?**

To truly be able to create something exceptional and keep it that way in the long term, things need to be systemised, without a system in place for people to follow even small projects can grow into a mess.

A Front-end Architect is there to put a robust system in place. As it is their specialism, they will know all the modern standards and the best practicies when it comes to setting a project up, they will know how to future proof it and ensure that it will be easily maintainable in the future.

As there is a system in place, other Front-end developers only need to follow a pre-set list of instructions, this means _**they do not need to be as highly skilled**_, which means you can spend less on HTML/CSS developers and put more money into JavaScript and/or backend developers, this will increase the projects integrity as a strong code-base is paramount to security and speed.

The initial outlay of a Front-end Architect will pay dividends in the long-term of the project.

As it happens, **I'm a pretty nifty front-end architect**. If you wish to hire me for your next project then you can find more details on my website: [www.alexward.co.uk](http://www.alexward.co.uk).

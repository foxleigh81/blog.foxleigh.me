A few years ago. I had something of an epiphany. I realised that the high-tech, high-stress world that I had worked hard to immerse myself in wasn't making me happy. That realisiation has slowly led my down a path to becoming more practically and naturally-minded. This is the place you will find posts about my endeavours to become more practical, less dependent on technology, less wasteful and most importantly, to free myself from the trappings of modern life.

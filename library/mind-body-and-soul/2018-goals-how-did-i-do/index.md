I swear I remember to do this article later every year.

2017 was a banner year for me. I achived so many of my goals that my life just lurched forward. That made 2018 a tough act to follow. However I did surprisingly well on my goals. Here's how I did.

<!-- end -->

## 1) Reach 200lbs: Failed

OK I didn't achive this one. Ah well, maybe next year.

## 2) Finish my novel: Failed

Nope! I didn't even get chance to get started, 2018 year was incredibly busy and frankly, I just couldn't prioritise it highly enough. 

## 3) Get a bath: Failed

I still don't have a bath, however I've made major headway into getting one, we now know what bath we want, we have designed our new bathroom (at least in our heads), we've had the preliminary work that was needed to be done, done and we've found a great plumber. So it's pretty likely that 2019 will be the year of the bath.

## 4) Achieve 100% remote work: Success!

I am now as close to 100% remote work as you can reasonably expect to be in my industry, I now only go in the office when there is a meeting or event which I cannot easily attend via video chat. This usually results in me only having to spend about 4-5 hours there every other week. Which is just find and dandy for me as I've got a new home office and I love it so much, I never want to leave it. (article coming soon)

## 5) Get a puppy and a kitten: Sort of success

TECHNICALLY this is a fail as the goal specified both a puppy and A kitten. We didn't manage the puppy but we now have not one but TWO cats! They are not kittens anymore as we got them right at the tail end of their kitten-hood and have now had them for about 6 months but they are still very much kitten-like and are lovely cats.

They are called Midnight and Shadow (we didn't name them, we got them from a rescue centre with those names - we love them though so we kept them) If you want to know more about them then they are already showbiz enough to have their own instagram profile. [Check them out here](https://www.instagram.com/midnight_and_shadow_cats/).

Here is a sneak peek:

So yeah, not quite as amazing as 2017 but it was never going to be but it was still a great year in it's own right and as my life trajectory only seems to go up lately, I'm looking forward to seeing what 2019 will bring!

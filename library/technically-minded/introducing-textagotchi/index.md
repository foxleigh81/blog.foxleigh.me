Our Leedshack project is well under way, we now have a [logo](https://twitter.com/textagotchi/status/229227417376526336/photo/1), a [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/textagotchi) and a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/textagotchi)! We're still not giving too much away though, maybe you can guess what we are doing?

The internet connection still isn't running to a reliable point yet so still no live stream, here is a picture of my face to make you happy though.

A few months ago I had an idea for a cover for my novel, it was a photo of Emily holding on to her mothers hand in the rain, it was quite a strong image but it related to a part of the novel which wasn't really all that significant, it was also a little bit 'in your face'. Whereas this cover idea that I've had says a hell of a lot (once you've finished reading the book) but is done with a lot more subtlety.

Obviously this is only a mock-up, the rabbit was not very carefully cropped and I've made almost no effort to match the lighting, however when I'm ready to get it up to kindle books or wherever then I'll make a bit more effort.

Your comments - as always - are appreciated.

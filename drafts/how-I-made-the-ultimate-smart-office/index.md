I've been trying to get my home office *just right* for years and never quite got to where I want it. This month, however we had some plumbing work done which required me to partially dismantle my office which was a great excuse to give it an overhaul and this time, I feel like I nailed it. My I present to you, the ultimate smart home office.

<!-- end -->

So, I had a few goals in mind when I was trying to plan this out:

- I didn't want to replace my furniture (or even move it if I could help it) as I like what I have and where it is placed.
- I wanted to be able to have cold water on tap in my office as I'm terrible at remembering to drink water
- I wanted to be able to control pretty much everything in my office from my desk
- I wanted it to be a fun relaxation space / man cave as well.

Annoyingly, I forgot to take any before pictures, I wanted this to be a transformation post but instead we'll have to settle for a 'how I did it' post. I did manage to do a 'post dismantle' shot so that will have to do for a 'before'.

I'll break it down into steps so you can just take the parts which you would find interesting:
